# iris-dataset-analysis 

## Task 1: Dataset Exploration
The `dataset_exploration.py` script loads the Iris dataset and performs exploratory data analysis, including displaying the first five rows, shape, and summary statistics.

## Task 2: Data Splitting
The `data_splitting.py` script splits the Iris dataset into training and testing sets and prints the number of samples in each.

## Task 3: Linear Regression
The `linear_regression.py` script uses a dataset with `YearsExperience` and `Salary` to train a linear regression model and evaluates its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have all necessary packages installed.
2. Run each script using Python:
   ```bash
   python dataset_exploration.py
   python data_splitting.py
   python linear_regression.py
